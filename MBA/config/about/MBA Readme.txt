The aim is to develop a standardized HTA Application with the following rules:
1. Create advanced scripting libraries for Windows system/network management
2. Make it module-based having the necessary functions and implements 
3. Make it common so that it can't be used on any Windows OS
4. Use standard techniques and implementations f ex XML, OOP
5. Make it portable so that is can't be executed from any location ex USB
6. Make it cost-effective for IT administrators, not having the need to purchase expensive development tools
7. Make it structured so that it easily can be adapted
8. Create with log and debugging functions
9. Make it scalable so that it can be changed, modified and expand
10. Use in-built Window functionality

This HTA Application should be able to include other made HTAs as long as the module rules are incorporated. The intension is to be able to develop all kind of Windows tools, f ex: SQL tools, Networking tools, Desktop tools, Games, Web tools, Document tools, Infrastructure tools etc. These tools can easily be included as modules using same and sharing the based implementation. The idea is to able to speed up HTA applications for Window use and include other colleague’s tools in one tool. This tool should be able to use in Enterprise environment in complex domain infrastructure, or at local workgroups
